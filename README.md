<h2 align="center">✨ Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub ✨</h2>

<p align="center">
  I'm a <strong>Software Engineering student</strong> who loves turning ideas into digital experiences that are both functional and beautiful. <br/>
  My journey started with curiosity for how websites work, and over time it grew into a passion for <strong>Frontend Engineering</strong> 🎨 and <strong>Software Design</strong> 🧩.
</p>

<p align="center">
  I enjoy working on the <strong>Frontend</strong> — crafting clean UIs with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> — 
  but I’m also exploring the <strong>Backend</strong> world 🌐 using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. <br/>
  Understanding how systems work from end to end motivates me to keep learning new frameworks, patterns, and tools.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🚀 My current goals include becoming a well-rounded <strong>Fullstack Engineer</strong> capable of designing scalable, maintainable systems. <br/>
  I’m especially interested in topics like <strong>Software Architecture</strong>, <strong>Testing</strong>, and <strong>AI-assisted development</strong> using <strong>LLMs</strong> and <strong>GraphRAG</strong>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🧠 I believe good software isn’t just about code — it’s about design, structure, and the experience it creates. <br/>
  Whether it’s a chatbot that helps students learn software design or a web app that simplifies workflows, I love projects that bring ideas to life.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🌱 Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech concepts, reading about science facts, and improving my problem-solving mindset. <br/>
  Every project I build is one step closer to mastering the art and science of software engineering.
